The finished product might be stored in the building, sometimes for a year or more. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Smokehouses are often secured to prevent animals and thieves from accessing the food. Traditionally, a smokehouse is a small enclosed outbuilding often with a vent, a single entrance, no windows, and frequently has a gabled or pyramid style roof.

			<Text>A blast furnace is used for smelting metals, generally iron. Fuel and ore are continuously supplied through the top of the furnace, while air is blown into the bottom of the chamber, so the chemical reactions take place throughout the furnace as the material moves downward.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Blast furnaces were invented in China and commonplace by 400 BCE, spreading to Europe by 1500 CE. Iron was essential to military success when the State of Qin had unified China in 221 BCE, and Chinese iron smelters of this era employed an average workforce of over two hundred men. By 1000 CE the Song Dynasty iron industry made a remarkable switch of resources from charcoal to bituminous coal in casting iron and steel, sparing thousands of acres of woodland from felling.</Text>
