These Harappan hydraulic engineering systems were even more efficient than those of many areas of Pakistan and India today, achieving large urban cities with relatively little agriculture development."

For example, Daniel Boone, a key figure in American pioneer history, settled in Kentucky, when that 'Dark and Bloody Ground' was still undeveloped.[NEWLINE]

			Text="In Japan, Shinto shrines exist side by side with Buddhist temples, and are the most numerous, famous, and important religious sites in Japan. A Shinto shrine is a structure or object whose main purpose is to house one or more Shinto kami (spirits, natural forces, or essence). Kami can reside in almost anything natural or man-made, from Mt. Fuji to a small jewel.  As such, these shrines are common and vary widely in scope. The Shrine itself can be a large building or small object, along a roadside, or might even be carried by people.[NEWLINE]
[NEWLINE]
Like Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines are not primarily a place of worship. The shrine's most important buildings are used for the safekeeping of sacred objects. There are specialized buildings for certain rites, but these are usually open only to a limited number of participants. Religious mass gatherings in the style of Christian churches do not take place with regularity and are not held inside the shrine. If many people are involved in a ceremony, it will assume a festive character and will be held outdoors."

			Text="A transition began towards machine-based factories in Great Britain's economy in the 1700s, previously reliant on manual labor and draft animals. These precursors to the Industrial Revolution started with the mechanization of the textile industries. Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of canals, improved roads, and railways. Wider utilization of water wheels and the introduction of steam power pushed dramatic increases in production capacity. The development of all-metal machine tools in the early 1800s facilitated the construction of increasingly refined  production machines for manufacturing in a wide variety of industries."
