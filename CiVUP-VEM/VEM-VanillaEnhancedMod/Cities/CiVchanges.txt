Overall building update philosophy:  Buildings at the high end are simply too expensive.  They take so long to build that you will never recover the cost investment in many cases and they never produce a benefit.  End game buildings need to be powerful enough to justify their cost and the small amount of time they will be present.  Also, many production buildings were so bad that you would never realistically recover the cost of making them because owning them was a net loss each turn.  There are also some buildings that felt very weak because of their comparison to others, in particular the Public School is strictly worse than the University and yet costs more and the Museum is identical to the Opera house and yet costs more.  Also many building paths contained a lot of buildings that were very boring, especially the culture buildings.

***Production 

Building updates:  I changed the Production buildings so that if they were built roughly when they became available that they would produce a decent net benefit per turn and pay themselves off over 40 turns or so.  Almost all production buildings needed a cost reduction and most needed a *massive* boost to effectiveness to achieve this.  Specifics of changes:

Workshop
Cost:  100 
GPT:  1 (was 2)
Benefit:  30% more production for buildings (was 20%)

Longhouse
Cost:  100 (was 80)
GPT:  1 (was 2)
Benefit:  30% more production for buildings and +1 Production on Forest/Jungle (did not have 30% for buildings)

Forge
Cost:  100 (was 150)
GPT:  1 (was 2)
Benefit:  35% more production for land units (was 15%)

Arsenal
Cost:  170 (was 350)
GPT:  2 (was 3)
Benefit:  50% more production for land units (was 15%)

Factory
Cost:  250 (was 300)
GPT:  3
Benefit:  50% more production

Windmill
Cost:  150 (was 180)
GPT:  2
Benefit:  30% more production (was 15%)

Nuclear Plant/Solar Plant/Hydro Plant
Cost:  450 (was 600)
GPT:  5 (was 3)
Benefit:  100% more production (was 25%)

Spaceship Factory
Cost:  250 (was 450)
GPT:  3
Benefit:  50% more production for spaceships

Seaport
Cost:  100 (was 150)
GPT:  2
Benefit:  2 Production on worked Fish/Oil/Whales tiles

***Happiness 

Buildings updates:  I changed the costs a little to flow better with the level of production available when the buildings unlock.  Overall lowering of all production costs, gold costs remained the same.  I lowered the costs of a courthouse substantially since right now puppetting is so great anyway.

Colosseum
Cost: 120 (was 150)
GPT: 4
Benefit: +3 Happiness

Circus
Cost: 120 (was 150)
GPT: 4
Benefit: +3 Happiness

Theatre
Cost: 240 (was 300)
GPT: 5
Benefit: +4 Happiness

Stadium
Cost: 360 (was 450)
GPT: 6
Benefit: +5 Happiness

Courthouse
Cost: 100 (was 200)
GPT: 3 (was 5)
Benefit: removes "occupied city" penalty.

***Culture 

Buildings updates:  Culture buildings were very weak unless actually going for a culture victory.  I wanted to differentiate the Opeara House and Museum, improve the buildings in general so they would be worth building if not going for Cultural Victory and offer some non cultural benefits to make them more interesting.  I also lowered the costs a little across the board.

Monument:  Unchanged

Temple
Cost: 110 (was 120)
GPT: 2
Benefit: +4 Culture (was +3 Culture)

Mud Pyramid Mosque
Cost: 110 (was 120)
GPT: 0
Benefit: +6 Culture (was +5 Culture)

Burial Tomb
Cost: 110 (was 120)
GPT: 0
Benefit: +3 Culture, +2 Happiness (was +2 Culture, +2 Happiness)

Opera House
Cost: 220 
GPT: 3
Benefit: +3 Culture, +1 Happiness (was +5 Culture, +0 Happiness)

Museum
Cost: 330 (was 350)
GPT: 3
Benefit: +6 Culture (was +5 Culture)

Broadcast Tower
Cost: 450 (was 600)
GPT: 5 (was 3)
Benefit: +100% Culture

***Food 

Building updates:  Granary/Smokehouse was a little expensive for how early it is in the tree, so it was lowered.  Water Mill was utterly rubbish before, now it is a very cheap building with a small effect.  The Medical lab was just too costly for how little time it would be active, cost and maintenance lowered.

Smokehouse
Cost: 70 (was 100)
GPT: 1
Benefit: +2 Food, +1 Food on Fish, Deer, Sheep, Cows

Water Mill
Cost: 40 (was 120)
GPT: 1 (was 2)
Benefit: +2 Food

Medical Lab
Cost: 250 (was 600)
GPT: 2 (was 3)
Benefit: Keep 75% of Food after growth.

Aqueduct, Hospital:  unchanged.

***Money 

Building updates:  The buildings that just made more money were really expensive and had very weak returns.  I lowered their costs some and increased the benefits on the Bank and Stock Exchange to make them actually worth building.

Market
Cost: 100 (was 120)
Benefit:  25% more Gold

Bazaar
Cost: 100 (was 120)
Benefit:  35% more Gold, extra copies of Luxuries

Bank
Cost: 170 (was 220)
Benefit:  33% more Gold (was 25%)

Satraps Court
Cost: 170 (was 220)
Benefit:  33% more Gold, +2 Happiness (was 25% more Gold, +2 Happiness)

Stock Exchange
Cost: 300 (was 650)
Benefit:  50% more Gold (was 33%)

***Defensive 

Building updates:  I set the maintenance costs of all Defensive buildings to zero.  They just weren't worth building/maintaining otherwise.  This fits in with the latest announcement of patch changes from Firaxis anyhow.

***Unit XP 

Building updates:  The fact that the later buildings were extremely expensive to build and maintain and they didn't give any more benefit than Barracks was very weak.  They just weren't worth building barring some kind of huge late game push with incredible cash behind it.  I upped the production and maintenance costs and increased their benefit drastically to make them powerful and to allow people to being experienced units into the game in the late going if they want to pay for it.

Barracks:  unchanged.

Armory
Cost: 160 (was 130)
GPT: 2 (was 3)
Benefit: +30 XP for Land Units (was +15 XP for Land Units)

Military Academy
Cost: 320 (was 350)
GPT: 4 (was 3)
Benefit: +60 XP for Land Units (was +15 XP for Land Units)

***Science

Building updates:  The university was simply superior to the Public School, having both more specialists, the Jungle bonus and also being lower cost.  I lowered the University benefit slightly and buffed the Public School to match.  I lowered the cost of the Research Lab so building it would be more worthwhile.

Library, Paper Maker:  unchanged

University
Cost:  200
GPT: 3
Benefit: +40% more science, +2 Science on Jungle (was +50% more science, +2 Science on Jungle)

Public School
Cost:  300 (was 350)
GPT: 3
Benefit: +60% more science (was +50% more science)

Wat
Cost:  200
GPT: 2
Benefit: +40% more science, +2 Science on Jungle, +3 Culture (was +50% more science, +2 Science on Jungle, +3 Culture)

Research Lab
Cost:  450 (was 600)
GPT: 5 (was 3)
Benefit: +100% more science, +1 Science on Water
